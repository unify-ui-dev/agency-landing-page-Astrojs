# Navigating a Career Change into Tech at 40

## The decision: "André, it is time for a new career!"

At the age of 39 I decided it was time for a change: a career change.  With two young children and a move across the world from Berlin to Australia on the horizon, the idea of switching careers and pivoting into the tech industry seemed like the best and most sensible idea ever. Furthermore, the fact that the German unemployment agency is very open to help people with career changes and discuss career options, by funding courses and training, this idea seemed to be the most logical: I wanted a job that would allow me to work from anywhere in the world and pay well, both unique selling points of this industry.

In this blog post, I will share shares my personal journey of making a major career change later in life, while also managing the demands of parenthood and a major international relocation. From the initial spark of inspiration to the challenges faced and the lessons learned along the way.

Whether you're in your 40s, juggling family responsibilities, or simply craving a change, I just want to let you know that it is never too late to do it - even when the odds may seem stacked against you.

## Golden Handcuffs

For nearly 15 years, I had built a successful career in marketing, working my way up the corporate ladder at various companies in Berlin. On paper, I had achieved the kind of professional success that many people strive for - a stable job, a comfortable income, and a respectable title.

After more than 10 years working as a teacher and teacher trainer, I had built a great reputation and was cherished by team members and colleagues. I really enjoyed my work, my team was amazing and I had the pleasure of working with a pool of 80+ great freelance teachers. On paper, I had what many people look for all their lives: a job they enjoy doing!

But deep down, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. On top of that our move to Australia was imminent (one year away) and I knew there wasn't much opportunity on the Sunshine Coast for language teachers. So I slowly started pondering about other options. I had hear of success stories of people who self-taught coding or did a bootcamp and landed a job in a technology company, I spoke to some of these people and other friends, who are software engineers and they all told me it was a great idea. Throughout this journey, I have always felt this unique sense of "everything is possible" amongst the developer community and just because you were never into programming, doesn't mean you can't!

Telling my manager that I wanted to leave the company was emotional and felt like a real break-up. I had seen the company grow from a 3 person to a 50 person operation, I had improved my skills as a teacher and a human being and became a central peace of the language school's charisma. But everyone was very understanding of the situation and gave me all the support I needed.

## Finding and Funding a Bootcamp

Once you are registered with the unemployment agency in Germany you are given access to a whole array of training and support to help you with your future professional endeavours. One of them being the "Bildungsgutschein" or "Education Voucher", which is basically them paying for any training you would like, as long as it seems fitting and sensible for you case.

Looking back, it all seemed too easy and relaxed getting a "cheque" for over 10.000€ from the agency for me to complete a 12 week full time bootcamp at one of the many providers in Berlin. My case worker said "It makes sense, I do not have much to offer for language teachers", plus there had been a recruiting boom in the tech industry in the last few year (2018-2022), more specifically in Berlin, so it all seemed like the promised land.

Also, schools are very keen to onboard people, because that is how they make their money, but in hindsight I would have wished for a bit more scrutiny during the recruitment process. Nonetheless, I ended up going with [SPICED](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en) as it was the closest to home and their curriculum included the most relevant tech stack. And I started the bootcamp just a month after the massive layoff in tech started happening!

## It's a continuos Team Effort

Being accepted into the bootcamp was just the beginning. It would have never worked out if I didn't have the full support of my wife, who, at the time was looking after Isaac (8 month old) full time, while also doing Kindergarten pick ups in the afternoon for Matilda (3 year old at the time). They all supported be from the get go with this career change.

### Overcoming Self-Doubt and Imposter Syndrome

Perhaps the biggest hurdle I faced was my own self-doubt and imposter syndrome. As a complete newbie to the tech industry, I constantly questioned whether I was in the right place.

These insecurities were amplified by the fact that I was surrounded by young, tech-savvy people, some of whom had been coding for a while. I worried that I would never be able to catch up, let alone excel in such a competitive field.

It only took me 2 weeks to ask one of the teachers, Sven, when should one quit, as I was having trouble with basic HTML and CSS 😅 His answer stuck with me and I continue pounding through this career switch:

*Once a marathon runner asked his coach: "Can I quit?"*

*The coach answered: "Of course you can quit! As long as you are not standing up!'*

It was a daily battle to silence the negative self-talk and maintain the confidence and determination needed to push forward. I had to constantly remind myself and be reminded by my wonderful team back at home that my diverse background and life experience could actually be an asset, and that I had the drive and intellectual capacity to master new skills, even a career change at 40!

## Persevering Through the Challenges

Faced with these daunting obstacles, it would have been a piece of cake to throw in the towel and settle for mediocrity. However, there was a lot at stake and I really wanted to succeed in this new career path.

### Embracing a Growth Mindset

One of the most important mindset shifts I had to make was adopting a true growth mindset. Rather than seeing my age and lack of technical experience as limitations, I reframed them as opportunities develop new capabilities.

I reminded myself that the industry values problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and the ability to continuously upskill - all qualities that I had honed over the course of my previous career field. I may not have had the same coding background as many of my younger peers, but I could leverage my strong communication skills, humor, and creative problem-solving abilities.

Whenever self-doubt crept in, I would focus on the progress I was making, however incremental. I focused on celebrating small wins, using them as fuel to keep pushing forward.

### After the Bootcamp

For the final project of my 12 week bootcamp, I created a tool that solved a problem that I used to have in my previous job: sourcing out data from zoom in a horrendous csv file and then comparing this info to teacher's invoices line by line. My tool, Sala, allows teachers to log in, teach an online session and generate invoices immediately from that single class or from several all together. Teacher wouldn't have to worry about invoices anymore, and schools about controlling those invoices.

However, it was too obvious that I had just gone through my first baby steps in the tech industry. I needed to continue learning, improving, gaining confidence. One thing that is very common in this new industry is that fact that new stacks, new updates and new EVERYTHING pop up every single day! It does not matter if you are a Junior or a Senior: reading and informing yourself about what is new is part of your daily life as a Developer.

On the last day of the bootcamp I had a chat with a guy that was just setting up his team at a startup he was building with a friend. Alexey had been a Senior Backend Developer at Smava - a German credit platform - and was now venturing into the AI space with a [Prevess](https://www.prevess.com/), an app for AI-powered nutrition and wellness recommendations. And he was also the hiring manager!

Because I still had other 6 months left on my unemployment benefits and very limited time, I asked Alexey if he was open to having me as an intern for 2 days a week, free of charge!

He said yes.

Exchanging my time for the opportunity of working in a team with goals, sprints and workflows was a no-brainer. Plus I got to work and chat with very experienced and helpful developers!

## Current Job Situation

By the time I finished my part-time internship at Prevess as a Frontend Developer in December, we had packed everything, left our apartment and were ready to make the big flight to the other side of the globe. By then I had also sent over 50 applications, practice as much as I could, but still got no replies and still felt like I was going nowhere.

That whole conversation with Sven kept coming back to my mind. And I stuck to it.

The job search here in Australia is even trickier: not only are most of the listed jobs 2 hours away from where we live, but almost all of the have a hybrid mode. The workforce in Australia is going back to the office! Plus, I can't really do a full-time job at the moment, because there is no full-time childcare here.

I needed to be practical, that is why I went back to teaching online. And it made me realise that, after more than a year trying to redefine myself professionally, teaching is still of my core strengths and passions. Although spending hours in front of my IDE trying to build stuff is becoming more and more pleasurable, despite the struggle

And If I can't get a job in tech right now, I will just create one!

One that fits my current work-life balance and will help me craft a professional network and make a successful presence in the local scene: So I created my own web agency called [Hinterland Web](https://www.notion.so/andresilv/hinterlandweb.com)! The deeper I dive into web development, the more I love it and the more I want everyone to be part of it!

## Lessons Learned and Advice for Others

Looking back on my journey, there are several key lessons and pieces of advice I would share with others considering a similar career pivot:

1. **Embrace the Opportunity to Reinvent Yourself**: Don't let age, family responsibilities, or a lack of direct experience hold you back. A career change can be daunting, but it also presents a chance to tap into new passions and build a more fulfilling future.
2. **Cultivate a Growth Mindset**: Believe in your ability to learn new skills and adapt to new challenges. Celebrate small wins, and don't be discouraged by setbacks. Consistent effort and a willingness to learn will go a long way.
3. **Highlight Your Unique Strengths**: Don't view your background as a liability. Identify how your diverse skills and experiences can complement your technical abilities and make you a more well-rounded, valuable asset.
4. **Stay Persistent and Adaptable**: The path to a successful career change may not be linear. Be prepared to encounter obstacles and setbacks, and have the resilience to keep pushing forward. Remain open to new opportunities and be willing to adjust your approach as needed.

## Conclusion: Make a Career Change

My journey of pivoting into web development at 40, while managing a family and an international move, has been nothing short of transformative. It has and it still requires immense sacrifice, grit, and a willingness to step outside my comfort zone. I has been a tough journey, but I enjoy it above all and always found support within the community!

If you're considering a similar career transition, I hope my story has inspired you to take that first step. Remember, it's never too late to reinvent yourself and pursue your passions. With determination, a growth mindset, and a strong support system, you can overcome the challenges and forge a new, rewarding path forward.
